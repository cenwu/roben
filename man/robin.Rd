robin(
  X,
  Y,

  clin = NULL,
  iterations = 10000,

}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the matrix of predictors (genetic factors) without intercept. Each row should be an observation vector. A column of 1 will be added to the X matrix
as the intercept.}

\item{Y}{the response variable. The current version of robin only supports continuous response.}

\item{E}{a matrix of environmental factors. The interaction terms between X (G factors) and E will be automatically created and included in the model.}

\item{clin}{a matrix of clinical variables. Clinical variables are not subject to penalty.}

\item{iterations}{the number of MCMC iterations.}

\item{burn.in}{the number of iterations for burn-in.}

\item{robust}{logical flag. If TRUE, robust methods will be used.}

\item{sparse}{logical flag. If TRUE, spike-and-slab priors will be used to shrink coefficients of irrelevant covariates to zero exactly.}

\item{structure}{three choices are available. "sparsegroup" for sparse-group selection, which is a bi-level selection on both group-level and individual-level. "group" for selection on group-level only. "individual" for selection on individual-level only.}

\item{hyper}{a named list of hyperparameters.}

\item{debugging}{logical flag. If TRUE, progress will be output to the console and extra information will be returned.}

\description{
fit a robust Bayesian variable selection model for GÃ—E interactions.
}
\details{
Consider the data model described in "\code{\link{data}}":
\deqn{Y_{i} = \alpha_{0} + \sum_{t=1}^{q}\alpha_{t}Clin_{it} + \sum_{m=1}^{k}\theta_{m}E_{im}  + \sum_{j=1}^{p} \big(U_{ij}^\top\beta_{j}\big) +\epsilon_{i},}
where the main and interaction effects of the jth genetic variant is corresponding to the coefficient vector \eqn{\beta_{j}=(\beta_{j1}, \beta_{j2},\ldots,\beta_{jL})^\top}.

When \emph{structure="sparsegroup"} (default setting), selection will be conducted on both individual and group levels (bi-level selection):
\itemize{
\item \strong{Group-level selection:} by determining whether \eqn{||\beta_{j}||_{2}=0}, we can know if the jth genetic variant has any effect at all.
\item \strong{Individual-level selection:} investigate whether the jth genetic variant has main effect, G\eqn{\times}E interaction or both, by determining which components in \eqn{\beta_{j}} has non-zero values.
}
If \emph{structure="group"}, only group-level selection will be conducted on \eqn{||\beta_{j}||_{2}}. If \emph{structure="individual"}, only individual-level selection will be conducted on each \eqn{\beta_{jl}}, (\eqn{l=1,\ldots,L}).
\cr

When \emph{sparse=TRUE} (default), spike--and--slab priors are imposed on individual and/or group levels to identify important main and interaction effects. Otherwise, Laplacian shrinkage will be used.

When \emph{robust=TRUE} (default), the distribution of \eqn{\epsilon_{i}} is defined as a Laplace distribution with density
\eqn{
f(\epsilon_{i}|\nu) = \frac{\nu}{2}\exp\left\{-\nu |\epsilon_{i}|\right\}
}, (\eqn{i=1,\dots,n}), which leads to a Bayesian formulation of LAD regression. If \emph{robust=FALSE}, \eqn{\epsilon_{i}} follows a normal distribution.
